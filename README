### Implementing new backward phase ####

-Implementing border node mapping to reduce border vector size (code files seems to have been deleted)

-Implementing PartitionVertexMapping for Vertex ID mapping between partition and grap, to reduce the vertex vector sizes.

-Adding the PartitionVertexMapping in graph28.h, in formDevicePartitions()
	This will not a circular dependency on Struct Partition. But will pass the elements as param.
	Each node vector will now be reduced to partition's num nodes size.
	All accesses to the node vectors will have to be through PartitionVertexMapping.
	For acceses where required a unidirectional mapping can be applied by passing PartitionVertexMapping's datastructures directly.

- Adding the border mapping to existing code.
	Implementation will only affect the code after partitioning !
	Change devicePartitions to use the mapping
	Change every code of borer request.
